**Notes from discussion**
add: cross referencing amongst session, try this session before or try this one after. Maybe add as tips
Where to include feedback of the facilitator on specific steps.

Need to create tip section:
old people multiply by two, young people a lot of activities.

## Meta information

### Description

### Overview

### Duration

### Ideal Number of Participants

	* 10 participants.
	* 1 facilitator.

### Learning Objectives

XXX: Add something about roles and power relationships.

##### Knowledge

- Framework to identify, analyse, and solve problems in collaborative processes.
- Know about technical tools that enhance collaboration.
- Criteria for the selection of such technical tools.

##### Skills

- Reflect on participatory processes and identify problems.
- Learn one or two new technical tools.

##### Attitude

- Think of participatory processes as systems that are evolving and require evaluation, redesign, improvements, etc.
- Decern if a collaborative process is problematic and whether technical tools would help.
- Fixate on the process and not so much on the tool.

## Steps

Version from Day 4 (260 min ~ 5 hours)
======================================

### Step 0: Presentation & introduction (10 min)

### Step 1: Problem identification (85 min)

Objectives:

	* Identify your processes
	* Relate your processes with other experiences
	* Analyze problems in current processes

Activity: (20 min: 5 min introduction + 10-15 small groups)

	* In small groups, listing down exisiting collaborative processes within their organization.

	* Seed the discussion with example of different types (decide, communicate, create, debate, etc.).
		* Note: Excluding outreach and impact work.

Discuss: (30 min)

	* Present these processes (~ 7 processes, 15 minutes).
	* Group the different processes by type, maybe add more types (5 min).

Input/Deepening: (30 min)

	* Identify successes and failures and flag them accordingly.
	* On selected examples:
		* What works?
		* What doesn't work?
		* Why do you think it doesn't work?

Synthesis: (5 min)

	* Summarize the grouping and other findings.
		* Success and failures are highly contextual.
	* Restate the objectives.

### Step 2: Success stories (55 min)

Activity: (15 min)

	* Go back to the list of processes and list the technical tools used in them (email, Twitter, Google Docs, etc.).
	* Map tools with type of processes.

Discuss: (15 min)

	* For the failures: do you think that adding a technical tool could solve the failure?
	* For the successes: do you think that it would have been successful without the technical tools?
	* Evaluation emotional aspects of these tools.

Input/Deepening: (20 min)

	* Examples of previous successful usage in other organizations.
		* Especially processes that were problematic and for which adding a technical tool helped.
	* Examples of current iniciatives.

XXX: Prepare selected examples.

Synthesis: (5 min)

	* Tooling: « There are certain tools that can be helpful for certain processes. »

### Step 3: Choose the right tools (70 min)

Objective:

	* Give organizations the capacity to select tools (learn about them, know how to choose, informed decision on the trade-off).

Activity: (5 min)

	* Gather the list of tools from previous step.
	* Who in the organization was behind these tools (choosing, managing, etc.)?
		* Note: be careful of who's attending (people from the same organization or many different organizations).

Discuss: (15 min)

	* From the previous examples, why did some tools failed to be useful or appropriate?
	* Start listing techno-political aspects: privacy, sovereignty, usability, inclusion, adaptability.
	* Put all this in perspective of group contexts and individual conditions.
	* Which roles, techno-social aspects, and power relationships these tools created inside the organization?

Input: (15 min)

	* Complete the list with missing techno-political aspects.
		* Phrased as a question: « Which other techno-political aspects do you think are also important? »

Deepening: (30 min)

	* Explore a bit the different aspects.
		* Note: Point to examples. relevant to the group.
	* Discuss the trade-off between these different aspects.
	* Deepen on holistic approach.

Synthesis: (5 min)

	* Reassess the trade-off.
	* Point to ressources and other sessions.

XXX: Standards & protocols

### Step 4: Problem solving (30 min)

	* Going back to selected failures from step 1, try to identify a tool that could help.
	* Going back to successes from step 1, could we find alternatives that could improve on other holistic aspects: techno-politics, well-being, etc.?
	* Hands-on!

### Step 5: End synthesis (10 min)

	* End synthesis
	* Commitments
	* Evaluation

Version from Day 5 (220 min ~ 4 hours)
======================================

Big picture:

  - Identify and analyze successes (80 min)
  - Presentation of new tools (60 min)
  - Problem solving (80 min)

### Step 0: Presentation & introduction (10 min)

### Step 1: Identify successes (80 min)

Activity: (15 min)

	* Group people by organization and list down successful collaborative processes that involved technical tools.
	* Seed the discussion with example of different types (decide, communicate, create, debate, etc.).
		* Note: Excluding outreach and impact work.

Discuss: (20 min)

	* All group get together and list processes in a wall according to types, people comment the initiatives listed and discussing success reasons
	* Reflect on the (techno-political) principles behind these successes.
	* Start listing techno-political principles: privacy, sovereignty, usability, inclusion, adaptability, well-being.
		* Put all this in perspective of group contexts and individual conditions.
		* Which roles, techno-social aspects, and power relationships these tools created inside the organization?
		* Evaluation emotional aspects of these tools.
	* Facilitator could seed more principles.

Input: (15 min)

	* Give an example of success of each type of process.
		* Especially proccesses that relates to the audience, local experience, current initiatives, etc.

XXX: Prepare selected examples.

Deepening: (20 min)

	* Distribute printed versions of each example.
	* Group people to reflect on how the previous principles applies to the example successes.

Synthesis: (10 min)

	* Have each group give a key finding.
	* Summary of principles.

### Step 2: Presentation of new tools (60 min)

	* Present 4-5 new tools that haven't been mentioned so far.
		* Screenshots.
		* Use cases.
		* Reflect on the techno-social aspects: pros and cons.
		* Get past experiences from the audience.
		* Q&A

### Step 3: Problem solving (80 min)

Activity:

	* Group people by organization and list down failures of collaborative processes.

Discuss:

	* Present the failures and reflect on them according to the principles identified in step 1.
	* Continue completing the list of principles.
		* Why did some tools failed to be useful or appropriate?

Input:

	* Give an example of failure for each type of process.
		* Especially proccesses that relates to the audience, local experience, current initiatives, etc.

Deepening:

	* Distribute printed versions of each example.
	* Group people to reflect on how the previous principles should apply to make these successful and which tools and shared agreements could correspond.

Synthesis:

	* Have each group give a key finding.
	* Summary of principles.
